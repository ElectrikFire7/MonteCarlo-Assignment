Question 4.24

GLOBAL VARIABLES
int i; acts as a counter variable to run interations to produce 'n' points
int n; stores the final number of points the user wants to use to calculate the value of pi
int totalPts; to count and store the number of points inside the circle

We define a function count(). It returns a void pointer, it is a way to signal pthread_join that child process has terminated.
It uses the rand() function to generate random coordinates. We devide it by RAND_MAX. This produces value between 0 and 1.
If the distnace of point from the origin < 1. totalpts increments.

In the main function, we first use srand(time(NULL)) to create a seed for random numbers to be generated.
pthread_t thread, creates a variable to store unsigned int value of thread identifier.
Then we take input for n untill it is positive.
Following this we call pthread_create(). We pass 'thread' so that we can store the data of thread created in it. Then we pass NULL in second attribute to set attributes of new thread created to default since we don't have any specifications. We pass count() function as third attribute, because we want the child thread to start executing there. The fourth attribuse is NULL as we don't expect a value to be entered from command line into argv[].
Once pthread_create() runs, the new thread runs inside count(). 
pthread_join() waits for the child thread to finish executing and update data. It makes the parent thread wait. 1st parameter mentions the thread id for which to wait. We pass NULL as second parameter as we don't expect a value to be returned from the child thread.
The we run the algorithm to count for ratio of area of circle/square which is approximately pi/4.
